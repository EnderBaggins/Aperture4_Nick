#+TITLE: TODOs in the code


* DONE Domain Communications
** [X] Communicate particles
** [X] Communicate fields

* TODO Data Export
** [ ] Write tracked particles
Should I put tracked particle data struct under the main particle data, or in
the data exporter class? Or in the ~particle_data_t~ class?
** [ ] How to make it easier to add more diagnostics?
* TODO Snapshot and Restart
** [ ] How to specify which data components need to be saved in a snapshot?
** [ ] Figure out a way to deal with xmf interaction with restarts
* TODO Implement various physical processes
** [ ] Curvature radiation
** [ ] Resonant scattering
** [ ] ICS scattering with arbitrary background
** [ ] Triplet pair production
* TODO Figure out a way to streamline setting up a new problem
** [ ] How to change pusher behavior?
** [ ] How to change radiative transfer behavior?
Partial answer: write a impl class for radiation then instantiate the
~radiative_transfer~ class with it.
* More general, how to make system interfaces even simpler?
